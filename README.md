- October 5, 2025
    - Changed the epoch switching from `collate_fn` to before the start of the DataLoader fetching loop. See [PR #601](https://github.com/kohya-ss/musubi-tuner/pull/601) for more details.
    - In the previous implementation, the ARB buckets were shuffled after fetching the first data of the epoch. Therefore, the first data of the epoch was fetched in the ARB sorted order of the previous epoch. This caused duplication and omission of data within the epoch.
    - Each DataSet now shuffles the ARB buckets immediately after detecting a change in the shared epoch in `__getitem__`. This ensures that data is fetched in the new order from the beginning, eliminating duplication and omission.
    - Since the shuffle timing has been moved forward, the sample order will not be the same as the old implementation even with the same seed.
    - **Impact on overall training**:
        - This fix addresses the issue of incorrect fetching of the first sample at epoch boundaries. Since each sample is ultimately used without omission or duplication over multiple epochs, the overall impact on training is minimal. The change primarily enhances "consistency in consumption order within an epoch," and the long-term training behavior remains practically unchanged under the same conditions (※ there may be observable differences in cases of extremely few epochs or early stopping).

    - Added a method to specify training options in a configuration file in the [Advanced Configuration documentation](./docs/advanced_config.md#using-configuration-files-to-specify-training-options--設定ファイルを使用した学習オプションの指定). See [PR #630](https://github.com/kohya-ss/musubi-tuner/pull/630).
    - Restructured the documentation. Moved dataset configuration-related documentation to `docs/dataset_config.md`.

- October 3, 2025
    - Improved the block swap mechanism used in each training script to significantly reduce shared GPU memory usage in Windows environments. See [PR #585](https://github.com/kohya-ss/musubi-tuner/pull/585)
        - Changed the block swap offload destination from shared GPU memory to CPU memory. This does not change the total memory usage but significantly reduces shared GPU memory usage.
        - For example, with 32GB of main memory, previously only up to 16GB could be offloaded, but with this change, it can be offloaded up to "32GB - other usage".
        - Training speed may decrease slightly. For technical details, see [PR #585](https://github.com/kohya-ss/musubi-tuner/pull/585).

- September 30, 2025
    - Fixed a bug in Qwen-Image-Edit-2509 LoRA training that prevented handling multiple control images correctly. See [PR #612](https://github.com/kohya-ss/musubi-tuner/pull/612)

- September 28, 2025
    - Support for training and inference of [Qwen-Image-Edit-2509](https://github.com/QwenLM/Qwen-Image) has been added. See [PR #590](https://github.com/kohya-ss/musubi-tuner/pull/590) for details. Please refer to the [Qwen-Image documentation](./docs/qwen_image.md) for more information.
        - Multiple control images can be used simultaneously. While the official Qwen-Image-Edit-2509 supports up to 3 images, Musubi Tuner allows specifying any number of images (though correct operation is confirmed only up to 3).
        - Different weights for the DiT model are required, and the `--edit_plus` option has been added to the caching, training, and inference scripts.

- September 24, 2025
    - Added `--force_v2_1_time_embedding` option to Wan2.2 LoRA training and inference scripts. See [PR #586](https://github.com/kohya-ss/musubi-tuner/pull/586) This option can reduce VRAM usage. See [Wan documentation](./docs/wan.md#training--学習) for details.
    
- September 23, 2025
    - The method of quantization when the `--fp8_scaled` option is specified has been changed from per-tensor to block-wise scaling. See [PR #575](https://github.com/kohya-ss/musubi-tuner/pull/575) [Discussion #564](https://github.com/kohya-ss/musubi-tuner/discussions/564) for more details.
        - This improves the accuracy of FP8 quantization, leading to more stable training and improved inference accuracy for each model (except HunyuanVideo). Training and inference speed may decrease slightly.
        - For LoRA training of Qwen-Image, the required VRAM for training is reduced by about 5GB due to a review of the quantized modules.
        - See [Advanced Configuration documentation](./docs/advanced_config.md#fp8-weight-optimization-for-models--モデルの重みのfp8への最適化) for details.

### Releases

We are grateful to everyone who has been contributing to the Musubi Tuner ecosystem through documentation and third-party tools. To support these valuable contributions, we recommend working with our [releases](https://github.com/kohya-ss/musubi-tuner/releases) as stable reference points, as this project is under active development and breaking changes may occur.

You can find the latest release and version history in our [releases page](https://github.com/kohya-ss/musubi-tuner/releases).

### For Developers Using AI Coding Agents

This repository provides recommended instructions to help AI agents like Claude and Gemini understand our project context and coding standards.

To use them, you need to opt-in by creating your own configuration file in the project root.

**Quick Setup:**

1.  Create a `CLAUDE.md` and/or `GEMINI.md` file in the project root.
2.  Add the following line to your `CLAUDE.md` to import the repository's recommended prompt (currently they are the almost same):

    ```markdown
    @./.ai/claude.prompt.md
    ```

    or for Gemini:

    ```markdown
    @./.ai/gemini.prompt.md
    ```

3.  You can now add your own personal instructions below the import line (e.g., `Always respond in Japanese.`).

This approach ensures that you have full control over the instructions given to your agent while benefiting from the shared project context. Your `CLAUDE.md` and `GEMINI.md` are already listed in `.gitignore`, so it won't be committed to the repository.

## Overview

### Hardware Requirements

- VRAM: 12GB or more recommended for image training, 24GB or more for video training
    - *Actual requirements depend on resolution and training settings.* For 12GB, use a resolution of 960x544 or lower and use memory-saving options such as `--blocks_to_swap`, `--fp8_llm`, etc.
- Main Memory: 64GB or more recommended, 32GB + swap may work

### Features

- Memory-efficient implementation
- Windows compatibility confirmed (Linux compatibility confirmed by community)
- Multi-GPU training (using [Accelerate](https://huggingface.co/docs/accelerate/index)), documentation will be added later

## Installation

### pip based installation

Python 3.10 or later is required (verified with 3.10).

Create a virtual environment and install PyTorch and torchvision matching your CUDA version. 

PyTorch 2.5.1 or later is required (see [note](#PyTorch-version)).

```bash
pip install torch torchvision --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu124
```

Install the required dependencies using the following command.

```bash
pip install -e .
```

Optionally, you can use FlashAttention and SageAttention (**for inference only**; see [SageAttention Installation](#sageattention-installation) for installation instructions).

Optional dependencies for additional features:
- `ascii-magic`: Used for dataset verification
- `matplotlib`: Used for timestep visualization
- `tensorboard`: Used for logging training progress
- `prompt-toolkit`: Used for interactive prompt editing in Wan2.1 and FramePack inference scripts. If installed, it will be automatically used in interactive mode. Especially useful in Linux environments for easier prompt editing.

```bash
pip install ascii-magic matplotlib tensorboard prompt-toolkit
```

### uv based installation (experimental)

You can also install using uv, but installation with uv is experimental. Feedback is welcome.

1. Install uv (if not already present on your OS).

#### Linux/MacOS

```sh
curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh
```

Follow the instructions to add the uv path manually until you restart your session...

#### Windows

```powershell
powershell -c "irm https://astral.sh/uv/install.ps1 | iex"
```

Follow the instructions to add the uv path manually until you reboot your system... or just reboot your system at this point.

## Model Download

Model download procedures vary by architecture. Please refer to the architecture-specific documents in the [Documentation](#documentation) section for instructions.

## Usage


### Dataset Configuration

Please refer to [here](./docs/dataset_config.md).

### Pre-caching

Pre-caching procedures vary by architecture. Please refer to the architecture-specific documents in the [Documentation](#documentation) section for instructions.

### Configuration of Accelerate

Run `accelerate config` to configure Accelerate. Choose appropriate values for each question based on your environment (either input values directly or use arrow keys and enter to select; uppercase is default, so if the default value is fine, just press enter without inputting anything). For training with a single GPU, answer the questions as follows:

```txt
- In which compute environment are you running?: This machine
- Which type of machine are you using?: No distributed training
- Do you want to run your training on CPU only (even if a GPU / Apple Silicon / Ascend NPU device is available)?[yes/NO]: NO
- Do you wish to optimize your script with torch dynamo?[yes/NO]: NO
- Do you want to use DeepSpeed? [yes/NO]: NO
- What GPU(s) (by id) should be used for training on this machine as a comma-seperated list? [all]: all
- Would you like to enable numa efficiency? (Currently only supported on NVIDIA hardware). [yes/NO]: NO
- Do you wish to use mixed precision?: bf16
```

*Note*: In some cases, you may encounter the error `ValueError: fp16 mixed precision requires a GPU`. If this happens, answer "0" to the sixth question (`What GPU(s) (by id) should be used for training on this machine as a comma-separated list? [all]:`). This means that only the first GPU (id `0`) will be used.

### Training and Inference

Training and inference procedures vary significantly by architecture. Please refer to the architecture-specific documents in the [Documentation](#documentation) section and the various configuration documents for detailed instructions.

## Miscellaneous

### SageAttention Installation

sdbsd has provided a Windows-compatible SageAttention implementation and pre-built wheels here:  https://github.com/sdbds/SageAttention-for-windows. After installing triton, if your Python, PyTorch, and CUDA versions match, you can download and install the pre-built wheel from the [Releases](https://github.com/sdbds/SageAttention-for-windows/releases) page. Thanks to sdbsd for this contribution.

For reference, the build and installation instructions are as follows. You may need to update Microsoft Visual C++ Redistributable to the latest version.

1. Download and install triton 3.1.0 wheel matching your Python version from [here](https://github.com/woct0rdho/triton-windows/releases/tag/v3.1.0-windows.post5).

2. Install Microsoft Visual Studio 2022 or Build Tools for Visual Studio 2022, configured for C++ builds.

3. Clone the SageAttention repository in your preferred directory:
    ```shell
    git clone https://github.com/thu-ml/SageAttention.git
    ```

4. Open `x64 Native Tools Command Prompt for VS 2022` from the Start menu under Visual Studio 2022.

5. Activate your venv, navigate to the SageAttention folder, and run the following command. If you get a DISTUTILS not configured error, set `set DISTUTILS_USE_SDK=1` and try again:
    ```shell
    python setup.py install
    ```

This completes the SageAttention installation.

### PyTorch version

If you specify `torch` for `--attn_mode`, use PyTorch 2.5.1 or later (earlier versions may result in black videos).

If you use an earlier version, use xformers or SageAttention.
